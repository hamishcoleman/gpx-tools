This is a collection of tools that allows management and rendering of a
collection of GPX files. 

gpx_split
    Given a "splitlist" file and a list of GPX files, split the input into
    multiple output files.
    This can be used to split daily gps log files into the "trips" they are
    part of.

gpx_split_outputlist
    Reads a "splitlist" file and generates the list of possible output names.

gpx_minmax
    For the given input files, generate a summary of the min and max
    timestamps seen.
    These summaries can be used as an index to speed up search operations.
